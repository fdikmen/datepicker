# datepicker
Upgrade for bootstrap datepicker <br/><br/>


The basic version of the codes is at https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker<br/>
I am developing on the codes here.<br/>


I created this project to make features that are not standard boostrap datepicker.

What I do for now;

1- Design change<br/>
2- A more responsive view<br/>
3- Inline type date range feature<br/>

I continue to improve.
